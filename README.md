# Online Shopper Conversion Prediction  
This project was done for an assignment in the course MTL782 Data Mining, Spring Semester 2024-25 at IIT Delhi.

The objective of this project is to predict whether an online shopper will make a purchase based on their activity and historical user trends.

It has 2 parts: 
1) Non-Competitive
2) Competitve  

The Non-competitive parts had several restrictions regarding allowed model and feature engineering, whereas in the Competitive part we had more freedom. Refer to MTL782-A1.pdf for complete problem statement.
